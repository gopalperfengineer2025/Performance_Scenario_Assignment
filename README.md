HTTPBin PerfTest Run Framework
This suite provides a repeatable, automated performance testing framework for validating API performance metrics under multiple load conditions. By containerizing HTTPBin and JMeter, the entire test lifecycle — setup, execution, teardown, and reporting — becomes one-command reproducible.

Overview This suite validates the performance and stability of the HTTPBin POST API endpoint under various load conditions using Apache JMeter and a Docker Compose environment.
